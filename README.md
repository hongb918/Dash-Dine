# Dash-Dine

## User-stories

When it comes to dinner, who else is suddenly indecisive? I want to build an app that shows users the nearest restaurants (in Dallas) hoping they can find their quickest meals. The suggestion page will show the name, image, cuisine, website, hours of operation and the location of the restaurant

As a user, I want to be able to filter the type of cuisines.
As a user, I want to be able to view the all cuisines on the first page.
As a user, I want to be able to click into each cuisine type and view all the suggested restaurants near me.
As a user, I want to be able to add my own restaurant suggestions.
As a user, I want to be able to update information about a restaurant if the data is outdated i.e restaurants changing address or updating hours etc,.
